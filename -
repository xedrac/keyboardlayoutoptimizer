# Base Effort

# This file describes the basic effort to strike each key on the keyboard layout.
# Values can range from 1 to 5+, where 1 is the least amount of effort and 5 is most.
# Because everyone is different, typing effort is very subjective.  You should
# modify these values to reflect how much effort you feel each key is to strike
